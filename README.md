# Battery Monitor

Battery Monitor is a utility to monitor the battery life of laptops. It displays a graph of the change in battery level with time. This is useful to estimate the amount of battery life that you are getting from your laptop, and to check the overall health.

**Average Life** is the amount of time your laptop takes to go from 100% to 0%. It takes a few charge-discharge cycles to get an accurate estimate of this value.

**Health** is the remaining life of battery. It is normally 100% when the battery is new, and slowly degrades with time.  For example, a two-year old laptop may show health of 80%, which indicates that only 80% of the original capacity is left.

**Red line** in the graph displays CPU usage. CPU usage is usually high if battery is discharging rapidly.

**Average life** is the overall battery life of the laptop, i.e. average time taken to go from 100% to 0% .
